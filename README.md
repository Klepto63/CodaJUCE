# Studio Coda

Studio Coda is a projet for music lover who wants to be fully immerged in their favorite songs.

With Coda you can place instruments in a 3D space and move aroun them. The goad is to create a immersive experience and help listener to fully distinguish any instrument, juste as if the concert was taking place in front of him. 

How does it work ? 
Your head is tracked by our IOT device called 'PREQUEL'. Then we can compute the relative position of each source in real time. We use state of the art audio plugins to simulate the presence of the instruments juste as if it were in front of you.
