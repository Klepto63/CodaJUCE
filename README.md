# Studio Coda

Studio Coda is a projet for music lover who wants to be fully immerged in their favorite songs.

With Coda you can place instruments in a 3D space and move around them. The goad is to create a immersive experience and help listener to fully distinguish any instrument, just as if the concert was taking place in front of him. It's is for example a great tool to learn how to listen to classical music and understand complex music patterns.

How does it work ? 
Your head is tracked by our IOT device called 'Prequel', placed on your prefered headphone. You then use our app 'Coda Music'. The Prequel will collect your head position and send it to the app in Bluetooth. We can now compute the relative position of each source in real time. We use state of the art audio plugins (Wave plugins) to simulate the presence of the instruments juste as if it were in front of you.

# Coda JUCE Sandbox

Coda JUCE sandbox is a windows application designed to be connected with the Prequel and help us in our further developpement of the solution.
With Coda JUCE sandbox we can :
* Connect to Prequel and test our algorithms
* Tweak the parameters and create perfect presets and 3D configurations
* Analyse the headtracking responsivity with an opengl display
* Play a demo over 10 classical songs
* ..and more to come !
